## Project Idea

While living in Ireland, I visited several local coffee shops and collected information about interesting coffee bean varieties available in stores.
Each coffee was carefully added to a database with details such as:

- origin
- roast level
- bean type
- description
- stores where it can be purchased

CoffeeScout allows users not only to browse this data, but also to **rate coffees, leave reviews, and build a personal coffee profile**.
